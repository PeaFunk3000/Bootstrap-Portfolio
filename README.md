# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This Bootstrap Portfolioe Webpage was a project undertaken as the Week 3 Challenge on my Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development.

The motivation was to build a portfolio page, similar to that built in  Week 2 using 'vanilla' HTML & CSS, i.e. from scratch, but this time utilising Bootstrap components in order to accelerate the design process and create a solution that minimises use of media queries.

## Usage
My Portfolio created using Bootstrap has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be found using the following link:

https://peafunk3000.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/


The website includes the following bootstrap components:

* A fixed position Navigation bar, including a 'hamburger' navigation menu at the top, when open within smaller viewports i.e. tablet/phone.

* Links that navigate to the appropriate sections on the webpage. 

* A hero/jumbotron featuring a picture of the 'ship' P-F:3000, along with information as to it's 'spec', as a fun, abstract representation of myself and my skills.

* A Carousel of the 'ship' P-F:3000's on-board technology, displaying software logos as a fun representation of my specific software skills.

* A work section displaying my work portfolio in grid, using Bootstrap cards for each work area. The descriptions in which give a brief overview of the work area.

* Bootsrap buttons as links that are applicable to my portfolios of work.
 These have not been linked to galleries yet, with exception of my GitHub, as will be created at a later date, also using Bootstrap components to tie the full portfolio together.

* All buttons display a hover effect.

* A Bootstrap contact form as a contact section.
